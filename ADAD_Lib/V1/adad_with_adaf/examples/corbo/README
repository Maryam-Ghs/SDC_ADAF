Here's how to compile corbo (aka ALPO) from the file I emailed you.

(1) Make a directory called corbo:
	mkdir corbo

(2) Move the email file to this directory:
	mv emailfile corbo		(assuming you called it emailfile)

(3) Move yourself to this directory:
	cd corbo

(4) Strip off the lines that mail attached to email file:
	vi emailfile			(you can skip this step if you don't
                                         mind a few error messages in the
                                         next step)

(5) Unbundle the email file:
	sh emailfile			

(6) Compile corbo:      		 
        make                            (make reads makefile which tells it how
	                                 to compile and link the source code
                                         modules - if you encounter
                                         difficulties, your local UNIX guru
                                         will undoubtedly know how to edit
                                         makefile so that it works on your
                                         system.  also, your guru may want to   
  					 edit makefile so that the optimizing
                                         compiler flags are turned on.)         

(7) Run a test problem: 		 
        corbo AFIRO.mps
