These are some potential examples of floating point adad applications.

f2c/

This is the fortran to c converter from Bell Labs. You use it to convert
F77 (fortran standard from 1977) code to C. You need to compile it etc.
ALTERNATIVELY, f2c may be available directly for your Linux platform, so
try that before worrying about this.

When you use f2c on a fortran code, it will transform ilm.f to ilm.c
and then when you do the compile, you need to add the f2c library to
the link like in order to get that to work, i.e.
    g++ ilm.o -lf2c -o ilm

blas/

These are the basic linear algebra routines, there you will see the BLAS
themselves in fortran (BLAS/src), and you want to use the single precision
versions starting with 's'. The BLAS come with tests which are in BLAS/TESTING.
You should convert the source files and the tests to C and then do the
adad/adaf magic on them.

corbo/

This is a linear program solver from Bell Labs. It is small and might be a good
candidate. It is in double, so would need to be changed to float first. There
is a test in the directory, plus *many* more if you want. I collected some
and can send.

k-means/

This is a simple C implementation of K-means machine learning classifier.

svm/

This is a simple C implementation of Support-Vector-Machine classifier.
